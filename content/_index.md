## English Grammar Notebook
This notebook is about grammar, which is a neglected subject for me.  I
always thought grammar was a pain in school.  Nonetheless, I'd like to 
start fresh.  Could I learn it better or reactivate my understanding now?  

How much grammar do you need to write blog articles, wiki entries, or 
school papers?  Years of slogging along to produce acceptable results?
My initial idea is to begin at some point (ie as I am today) and
try to learn by reading about grammar and writing as much as I can.  For writing, 
I have this notebook and a few others.  I can write blog entries, also 
small topics.  

One goal I have is to create an app that will be useful for students to 
learn writing skills.
